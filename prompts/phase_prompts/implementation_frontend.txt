The architecture design for this implementation is:
{architecture}

[PROJECT STANDARDS & RULES]:
{golden_rules}

IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
1. Produce the necessary React components, hooks, and types to implement the requested feature. 
2. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do not use <div>, <span>, <button>, <a>, <input>, or any other native HTML tags directly. 
3. ALL UI must be built using @dyn-ui/react components. If you need a semantic tag, use <DynBox as="...">.
4. FOLLOW THE FALLBACK PROTOCOL: If a requirement isn't in DynUI, compose it from primitives (DynBox, DynFlex, DynStack, DynTypography).
5. If composition is impossible, add a "PROPOSAL" block in the code comments explaining the DynUI-based alternative.
6. STRICTLY FOLLOW the 3-Layer Token System and Component Composition rules.

Return JSON format with a list of files: {"files": [{"path": "...", "content": "..."}]}.
Code should be complete and ready to use.
