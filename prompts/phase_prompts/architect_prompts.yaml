instructions:
- Map requirements to discovered DynUI components first.
- Design compositions for unmatched requirements using primitives.
- Include source_paths for every DynUI component used.
- Define data_flow, token references, and storybook_patterns.
- DO NOT read source .tsx files — leave that to Implementer.
checks:
- All UI elements map to DynUI components or compositions
- Security and observability included
- Trade-offs briefly noted
- source_paths provided for Implementer
- tokens_used includes specific token names
